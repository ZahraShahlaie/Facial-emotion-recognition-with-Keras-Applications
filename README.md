4. Building Model:

5. VGG16 Model:

  - Loads the pre-trained VGG16 model with ImageNet weights, excluding the top layer (freezing the convolutional base).
  - Defines the complete model architecture with data augmentation, pre-processing for VGG16, global average pooling, and dense layers for classification.
  - Compiles the VGG16 model with the Adam optimizer, sparse categorical cross-entropy loss, and accuracy metric.

  - Evaluates and plots training and validation accuracy and loss curves.
  - Fine-tunes the VGG16 model by making some convolutional layers trainable.

  - Plots the combined training and validation loss and accuracy curves.

6. VGG19 Model (Similar to VGG16):
  -	Repeats the same steps as VGG16 for VGG19, including model building, training, fine-tuning, and evaluation with plots
7. ResNet50 Model (Similar to VGG16):
  -	Repeats the same steps as VGG16 for ResNet50, including model building, training, fine-tuning, and evaluation with plots
8. MobileNetV2 Model (Similar to VGG16).

This script demonstrates transfer learning with pre-trained VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50 and MobileNetV2 models for facial expression recognition. It addresses imbalanced data using oversampling and visualizes the training process. You can experiment with different hyperparameters and explore other pre-trained models for potentially better performance.

9. Custom Model (My Model):
  - This custom CNN architecture defines a model from scratch for facial expression recognition.
  -The architecture employs convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, dropout layers for regularization, and dense layers for classification.
  - Hyperparameters like the number of filters, learning rate, and epochs can be tuned to improve performance.
  - The code following the training section extracts training and validation accuracy/loss curves from the training history and visualizes them using Matplotlib.

10. Evaluation:
  -This section outlines the code for evaluating the performance of your facial expression recognition models:
  Evaluation Function:
  -evaluate_model(model, test_ds): This function takes a trained model and the testing dataset as input.
  -It calculates the test loss and accuracy using the model's evaluate method.
  -Extracts true labels from the test dataset and predicted labels from the model's predictions on the test data.
  -Creates a confusion matrix using sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix to visualize how often the model predicted each class correctly or incorrectly.
  -Plots the confusion matrix using Seaborn (sns.heatmap) with annotations (annot=True) for clarity.
  -Generates a classification report using sklearn.metrics.classification_report to provide detailed information about the model's performance on each class.
  -Returns the test accuracy for comparison purposes.

•	Evaluating Pre-trained Models (if applicable):
  - The code iterates through your pre-trained models (assuming model_vgg16, model_vgg19, model_resNet50, and potentially model_mobileNetV2) and calls the evaluate_model function for each model with the testing dataset.
  - The test accuracy for each pre-trained model is stored in a variable (e.g., acc_vgg16, acc_vgg19, etc.).

•	Evaluating Custom Model.
  - The code calls the evaluate_model function with your custom model (my_model) and the testing dataset.
  - The test accuracy for your custom model is stored in acc_my_model.
    
    Comparing Model Performance:
  - A dictionary named evaluate_models is created to store the test accuracies for each model (VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, MobileNetV2 (if applicable), and MY_Model).
  - A Pandas DataFrame (df) is created from the dictionary to provide a tabular comparison of the models' test accuracies.

11. Prediction on a Single Image
   
This section demonstrates how to use your trained model (my_model) to predict the facial expression for a single image:

•	Image Loading:
  - Defines an image path (img_path) pointing to the image you want to predict.
  - Loads the image using OpenCV (cv2.imread).

•	Preprocessing:
  - Resizes the image to the expected input size for the model (e.g., 48x48 pixels using cv2.resize).
  - Expands the dimension of the image to match the model's expected input shape (batch size of 1) using np.expand_dims.

•	Prediction:
  - Uses the model to predict the probability distribution for each facial expression class (predictions = my_model.predict(img)).
  - Applies softmax activation (tf.nn.softmax) to convert the predictions into probabilities.
  - Identifies the class with the highest probability (np.argmax(score)) and retrieves its corresponding label from class_names.
  - Prints the predicted facial expression class and its probability.

12. Visualizing Predictions on a Batch of Images
   
This section showcases how to visualize predictions on a batch of images from the testing dataset:

•	Grabbing a Batch:
  - Takes one batch of images (images) and their corresponding labels (labels) from the testing dataset using test_ds.take(1).

•	Prediction and Visualization:
  - Iterates over the images in the batch.
  - Predicts the probability distribution for each image using the model (predictions = my_model.predict(images)).
  - Applies softmax activation to convert predictions into probabilities (score = tf.nn.softmax(predictions[i])).
  - Displays the image using plt.imshow.
  - Overlays the predicted facial expression class with its probability on the image using plt.title.
  - Turns off the axis labels (plt.axis("off")).

•	Displaying the Batch:
  - Shows the entire batch of images with their original and predicted labels in a 3x3 grid layout using plt.show().

13. Saving the Model
    
This section demonstrates how to save your trained custom model (my_model) for future use:
  - my_model.save("my_model.h5"): Saves the model to a file named "my_model.h5" in the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5), a common format for saving deep learning models.
