# Facial Emotion Recognition with Keras Applications

This project involves training a facial emotion recognition model using transfer learning with pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The code is designed to handle imbalanced datasets, perform data augmentation, and visualize training results. The models evaluated include VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2, along with a custom CNN model.

## Introduction
This project processes a facial emotion recognition dataset, trains multiple models using transfer learning, and evaluates their performance. The script includes handling imbalanced data, visualizing data distributions, and reporting results.

##  Summary Features
- Downloads and preprocesses a facial emotion recognition dataset from Kaggle.
- Handles imbalanced data using RandomOverSampler.
- Uses transfer learning with pre-trained models (VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, MobileNetV2).
- Implements a custom CNN model.
- Visualizes training and validation metrics.
- Evaluates models using confusion matrix and classification report.
- Predicts facial expressions for single images and batches.
- Saves the trained model for future use.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facial-emotion-recognition.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd facial-emotion-recognition
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
